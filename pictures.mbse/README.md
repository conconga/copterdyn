# copterdyn

**copterdyn** is a sophisticated simulator for a quadcopter modeled using
multibody simulation concepts.

# history

The quadcopter simulator is outdated, and with its first version completed in 2017.
It was developed using Python 2.7, without any compatibility to any Python
3.0. This was critical in particular with debugging information and frame
generation (animations). Additionally, the first implementation had other issues.
For instance, while the simulation of the dynamics impressive, the project lacked a proper propeller model, and a
piloting (controlling) algorithm. Moreover, the interfaces to any guidance inadequate.

# refactoring

As my career banked to systems engineering, I made a decision to reshape the project
with some reasonable increments aiming at bringing it reviving the project also for
python 3, populating the simulation with the complete GNC
(guidance-navigation-control) and sensing, and enhancing the clarity at any
interface level.

The next paragraphs and respective diagrams will provide the details about the new project, and what is
expected to have achieved.

## use case diagram

The System-of-Interest will provide at least three services:
* to simulate any hover maneuver of the quadcopter (configured by the user);
* to simulate sensors as described by a comercial datasheet; GPS data is an input for the navigation, and will be generated by the sensor simulator;
* to calculate any navigation data, position, velocity and acceleration.

## context diagram

The Context-Diagram for the System-of-Interest (SoI) does not depict any
surprises. The SoI interacts with the User at lauching of any simulation, and
provides data to a logger, file, or disply unit.

## Activity: Simulate Hover

The UseCase "Simulate Hover" is decomposed into its part subfunctions. Here the
role of Guidance and Piloting are represented by the functions "calculate
trajectory" and "calculate control commands".
